# **SQL HEROES TEMPLATE** 

## Setup
- After creating your own repo from the template, create a local copy either with the Github CLI tool (recommended) or a git clone.
- Make sure you have Docker Desktop downloaded and running
- Open VScode and install the [Dev Containers Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
- Open your repo in VScode, after a few moments you should see a prompt from VScode asking if you want to reopen the repo in a dev container, follow the prompt to do so. If you are not prompted, you can click the remote connection icon in the bottom left corner and select 'Reopen in Container'
- Once the container is built, click the SQL tools extension to establish your database connection. All required fields, including password, are 'postgres'.
- Proceed to set up your file structure per Project document.
